# 101: 1D Laplace equation 
([source code](SOURCE_URL))


Let $\Omega=(\gamma_1,\gamma_2)$ with $\gamma_1=0$, $\gamma_2=1$.
This is the simplest second order boundary value problem (BVP)
for a partial differential equation  (PDE):

```math
-\Delta u =0\\
u(\gamma_1)=g_1\\
u(\gamma_2)=g_2.
```

We replace the Dirichlet boundary condition by a Robin boundary
condition with a penalty parameter $\frac{1}{\varepsilon}$:

```math
\nabla u(\gamma_1) + \frac{1}{\varepsilon}(u(\gamma_1)-g_1)=0  \\
-\nabla u(\gamma_2) + \frac{1}{\varepsilon}(u(\gamma_2)-g_2)
=0  
```

This penalty method for the implementation of Dirichlet
boundary conditions is used throughout VoronoiFVM.


In order to discretize it, we choose collocation points
$\gamma_1=x_1 < x_2 < \dots < x_n=\gamma_2$.

For instance, we can choose 6 collocation points in $(0,1)$:
From these, we create a discretization grid structure
for working with the method.

This implicitely creates a number of control volumes $\omega_k $ around each
discretization point $x_k$: Let
$\sigma_{k,k+1}=\frac{x_k+x_{k+1}}{2}$. Then $\omega_1=(\gamma_1,\sigma_{1,2})$,
$\omega_k= (\sigma_{k-1,k}, \sigma_{k,k+1})$ for $k=2\dots n-1$, $\omega_{n}=(\sigma_{n-1,n},\gamma_2)$. 

```
 x1    x2    x3    x4    x5    x6
 o-----o-----o-----o-----o-----o
 |--|-----|-----|-----|-----|--|
  ω1  ω2     ω3    ω4    ω5  ω6
```

For each $\omega_k$, we integrate the equation

```math
\begin{aligned}
0&=\int_{\omega_k} -\Delta u d\omega=  -\int_{\partial \omega_k} \nabla u ds\\
&= \begin{cases}
u'(\sigma_{1,2}) - u'(0)& k=1\\
u'(\sigma_{k,k+1}) - u'(\sigma_{k-1,k}) & 1<k<n\\
u'(1)- u'(\sigma_{n,n+1})&k=n
\end{cases}\\
&\approx \begin{cases}
\frac{1}{x_2-x_1} g(u_1,u_2) + \frac{1}{\varepsilon}(u_1-0)& k=1\\
\frac{1}{x_k-x_{k-1}}g(u_k,u_{k-1}) -\frac{1}{x_{k+1}-x_{k}}g(u_{k+1},u_{k}) & 1<k<n\\
\frac{1}{\varepsilon}(u_n-1)+ \frac{1}{x_n-x_{n-1}} g(u_{n},u_{n-1})&k=n
\end{cases}
\end{aligned}
```

In the last equation, we wrote $u_k=u(x_k)$ and $g(u_k,u_l)=u_k-u_l$. For
the interior interfaces between control volumes, we replaced $u'$ by a
difference quotient. In the boundary control volumes, we replaced $u'$  by the boundary
conditions.

In the example below, we fix a number of species and  write a Julia function describing $g$,
we create a physics record, and a finite volume system with one unknown species and
a dense matrix to describe it's degrees of freedom
(the matrix used  to calculate the solution is sparse).
We give the species the number 1 and enable it for grid region number one 1.
Then, we set boundary conditions for species 1 at $\gamma_1, \gamma_2$.

We create a zero initial value and a solution vector
and initialize them.

With these data, we solve the system.



We wrap this example and all later ones
into a module structure. This allows to load
all of them at once into the REPL without name
clashes. We shouldn't forget the corresponding end
statement.
