# Changes
## v0.14.0
Backward compatible API overhaul.

- Boundary conditions are now specfied in breaction
  Advantages:
   - easy x/t dependency
   - unified (upcoming) interface for parameters
   - unified handling of standard and nonstandard boundary conditions
   - simpler documentation
   
function bc!(args...)
    boundary_dirichlet!(args...,region=1,value=0)
    boundary_dirichlet!(args...,region=3,value=1)
end

- System constructor now directly takes physics callback functions
    sys=VoronoiFVM.System(grid; species=1,flux=flux!,reaction=reaction!,breaction=bc!)
-  solve() now takes "NewtonControl" parameters as kwargs

solution=solve(sys; verbose=false, blob=true)



## v0.13.2 Oct 29, 2021
- Bernoulli function overhaul
## v0.13.1
- sorted things with ExtendableGrids
- nodal flux reconstruction (e.g. for visualization)
## v0.13.0, Oct 13, 2021
- various bug fixes, explicit numbering of edge nodes

## v0.12.3, July 7, 2021
- Add quantity id
- Document quantities

## v0.12.2, July 7, 2021
Introduce the notion of quantities which can be continuous or discontinuous at interfaces.

- Quantity handling is implemented on top of species handling
- Unknowns u and rhs y now passed to callbacks as wrapper types, 
  and can be indexed by quantity or by species numbers. 
  Moreover, this will allow to abstract parameters, gradients etc. in future versions.

## v0.12.0, July 2 2021
-  By default, the `u` parameter in flux callbacks is now a  `nspec x 2` array
- `unknowns(edge,u)`, `viewK, viewL` are obsolete, they still work for backward compatibility
- `physics.num_species` is now meaningless, num_species is automatically detected.
- `SparseSystem` and `DenseSystem` are now type aliases of a parametrized type instead of two
   independent subtypes of `System`

## v0.11.8
- increase chunk size threshold to match argument length in calls to vector_mode_jacobian

## v0.11.7
- First attempts on surface flux

## v0.11.1, April 13, 2021
- Assembly loops cleaned from type instabilities
- Optionally check for allocations due to type instabilities introduced in physics callbacks.
  See [`check_allocs!`](@ref) for more information.

## v0.11, April 12, 2021
- Depending on Julia 1.5 now
- Lineaer solvers now based on factorize! from ExtendableSparse 0.5
- Documentation overhaul
- Re-checking impedance calculation

## v0.10.13 April 1, 2021
- Outflow boundary conditions

## v0.10.8 March 22, 2021
- TransientSolution structure, transient solve
- Solve compatible with DifferentialEquations.jl

## v0.10.3 Feb 11, 2021
- Introduce non-mutating solve
- Optionally record history if log kw is true in solve.

## v0.10.0 Jan 9 2021
- Moving visualization to the package [GridVisualize.jl](https://github.com/j-fu/GridVisualize.jl), emerging from 
  the visualization methods in ExtendableGrids


## v0.9.0 Dec 21 2020
- Add the possibility to interface with [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/stable/)
- __Breaking__: The API change to passing the unknowns to the
  an edge callback as a matrix turned out to be a dead end in the
  strategic sense. In order to extend functionality, we need to be able
  to pass more data to  which we can apply differetiation. Particular plans
  involve bifurcation parameters and reconstructed gradients.
  So we return to the viewK/viewL pattern we had before. However, 
  these are now aliases:
  - `viewK(edge,u)=unknowns(edge,u,1)`
  - `viewL(edge,u)=unknowns(edge,u,2)`
  In order to ease refactoring in the case where models have been
  implemented with Matrix access to the unknowns, `unknowns(edge,u)`
  returns a matrix of the edge unknowns.   
  For refactoring, just rewrite e.g.
```julia
    function flux(y,u,edge)
        for ispec=1:nspec
            y[ispec]=u[ispec,1]-u[ispec,2]
        end
    end
```
  to
```julia
    function flux(y,u0,edge)
        u=unknowns(edge,u0)
        for ispec=1:nspec
            y[ispec]=u[ispec,1]-u[ispec,2]
        end
    end
```


## v0.8.5 Sep 1 2020
- allow any object in Physics.data  (thanks Jan Weidner)
- add generic operator for non-canonical problem structures

## v0.8.4 July 25 2020
- Update ExtendableGrids + ExtendableSparse

## v0.8.3 June 25 2020
- Replace splatting by dispatch on availability of data record

## v0.8.2 May 15 2020
- Form factors are now pre-calculated and stored
- Introduced update_grid! for triggering re-calculation
  if coordinates have changed

## v0.8.1 May 2 2020
- Introduce evolve! : time solver with automatic timestep control

## v0.8 Apr 28, 2020
- Replaced VoronoiFVM grid module by  [ExtendableGrids.jl](https://github.com/j-fu/ExtendableGrids.jl)
- Moved grid generation, modification, plotting  over to ExtendableGrids
- Necessary changes in codes using VoronoiFVM:
  - Replace `grid.coord` by `coord` obtained via `coord=coordinates(grid)` or  `coord=grid[Coordinates]` after importing ExtendableGrids
  - Replace `VoronoiFVM.plot` by `ExtendableGrids.plot`.
  - In the plot method, Plotter is now a keyword argument
  - `VoronoiFVM.Grid()` now returns a ExtendableGrids.ExtendableGrid, 
    in fact it is just an alias to [ExtendableGrids.simplexgrid](https://j-fu.github.io/ExtendableGrids.jl/stable/search/?q=simplexgrid)
  - For using any methods on grids like cellmask! one nees to use `ExtendableGrids`
  - Subgrids now are of the same type `ExtendableGrids`,  views are currently defined for vectors only.
  
## v0.7 Feb 28 2020
- API modification:
  - __Breaking__:
    - `data` parameter passed to physics callbacks only if `Physics` object is created with `data` parameter.

      This makes the API more consistent in the case that parameters are just taken from the closure (the scope where the physics functions are defined)
      and no data `object` has been created.
    - Replace `node.coord[i]` by  `node[i]`.
    - Replace `edge.coordK[i]` by  `edge[i,1]`.
    - Replace `edge.coordL[i]` by  `edge[i,2]`.

      This now directly accesses the coordinate field of the grid and avoids copying of the coordinates
  - Backward compatible:  
    - No need for `viewK and viewL` in edge callbacks (they also make trouble with allocations...)
        - Replace `uk[i]` by `u[i,1]`
        - Replace `ul[i]` by `u[i,2]`
     - Replace `VoronoiFVM.DenseSystem(...)`  by `VoronoiFVM.System(..., unknown_storage=:dense)`
     - Replace `VoronoiFVM.SparseSystem(...)` by `VoronoiFVM.System(..., unknown_storage=:sparse)`

- No allocations anymore in assembly loop:
  - Replaced `ElasticArray` in `Grid` by normal one - this was the largest regression
  - Return `nothing` from mutating methods to avoid some allocations 
  - Indexing in `formfactors.jl` with `Int`

      any bulk_solution stuff or whatever when using the sparse variant
- Re-export value() for debugging in physics functions

  In particular, velocity vectors can be passed this way.

  - Besides of `flux!()`, they now all have `node::VoronoiFVM.Node`
    as a second argument.

  - `flux!()` has `edge::VoronoiFVM.Edge` as a second argument

  - the `x` argument in `source!()` is omitted, the same data
     are now found in `node.coord`


- New method `edgelength(edge::VoronoiFVM.Edge)`
