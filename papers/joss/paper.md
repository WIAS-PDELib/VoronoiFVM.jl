# Summary
The finite volume method is a space discretization approach for partial differential equations 
which is based on the idea to regard species balances of communicatiog representative elementary volumes (REVs aka control volumes). It thus resembles
the physics of many types of natural processes like transport, diffusion, heat conduction ... 
The VoronoiFVM.jl package focuses on one particular way to construct control volumes 
which is most useful for second order partial differential equations. 
It implements the method for systems of PDEs on simplicial grids in one, two  or three space dimensions.
